# README

The only unique thing I did here was stick a Postgres Database onto the Transloadit rails tutorial, and in that database I stored urls and titles for each
waveform that was created.

Then, I built the `index` page and a `create` method in the controller so that links to waveforms would be saved when they were made...kind of like a mini paperclip.

I also stored them in my AWS S3 bucket.

Have a look around.
