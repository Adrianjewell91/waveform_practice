The only unique thing I did here was stick a Postgres Database onto the Transloadit tutorial, and in that databased I stored urls and titles for each
wave form that I created.

Then, I built the index page and a create method in the controller so that links to waveforms would be saved when they were made...kind of like a mini paperclip.

I also stored them in my AWS S3 bucket.

Have a look around.
